# TIFeD

TIFeD is the implementation of an integer-based federated learning algorithm for the on-device training of Neural Networks.

TIFeD has been introduced in the [paper]() "TIFeD: a Tiny Integer-based Federated learning algorithm with Direct feedback alignment".

*Disclaimer: we are working on the topic, so, expect changes in this repo.*
